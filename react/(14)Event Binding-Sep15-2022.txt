                            React Event Binding
                            ----------------------------
    - Event is a message sent by sender to its subscriber in order notify
      change.
    - Event follows a software design pattern called "Observer".
    - Observer is a behavioural pattern [Communication].
    - Event uses a delegate mechanism [function pointer].

    Syntax:
            function InsertClick() { }                    => Subscriber

            <button onclick="InsertClick()">        => Sender

    - Subscriber defines actions to perform.
    - Sender sends a notification, that specifies when the actions need to
      perform.
    - JavaScript Events are configured by BOM
        [Browser Object Model]
    - BOM comprises of
        - window
        - location
        - navigator
        - history
        - document [DOM]
    - Events are defined by "window" object
    - React can't access "window" object
    - React is using Virtual DOM hence it can't handle direct BOM.
    - React can't access Browser Events.
    - React uses "SyntheticEvents" library that communicates with
      browser events.

        SyntheticEvent [onClick] => maps => Browser Event [onclick]

    - React SyntheticEvents are all same as Browser Events

            1. Mouse Events
                    onMouseOver
                    onMouseOut
                    onMouseDown
                    onMouseUp
                    onMouseMove
            2. Keyboard Events
                    onKeyup
                    onKeydown
                    onKeypress
            3. Button Events
                    onClick
                    onDblClick
                    onContextMenu
            4. Element State Events
                    onChange
                    onBlur
                    onFocus
                    onSelectStart
            5. Clipboard Events
                    onCut
                    onCopy
                    onPaste
            6. Form Events
                    onSubmit
                    onReset
            7. Timer Events
                    setTimeOut
                    clearTimeOut
                    setInterval
                    clearInterval
            8. Touch Events
                    onTouchStart
                    onTouchEnd
                    onTouchMove  etc..

        - JavaScript defines 2 default event arguments
                    a) event
                    b) this
        - "event" sends the properties of current event, like
                    clientX,
                    clientY
                    keyCode
                    which
                    altKey etc..
        - "this" sends the properties of current object, like
                    id, name, value, className etc..

        - React SyntheticEvents can have only "event" as default
          argument.

        - We can access object related properties by using
            "event.target"

                event.clientX
                event.clientY
                event.ctrlKey

                event.target.id
                event.target.name
                event.target.className

        - It also allows to configure custom arguments.

Ex: Event Binding

export function EventBinding()
{
    function InsertClick(SynthenticEvent){
        console.log(`
            Button Id : ${SynthenticEvent.target.id} \n
            Button Name: ${SynthenticEvent.target.name} \n
            X Position : ${SynthenticEvent.clientX} \n
            Ctrl Key    : ${SynthenticEvent.ctrlKey}

        `);
    }
    return(
        <div>
            <button onClick={InsertClick} id="btnInsert" name="Insert">Insert</button>
        </div>
    )
}

        Note: React can't directly access BOM objects [window, history..]
                It requires various Hooks.
