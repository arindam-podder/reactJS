Route
Route Parameters
Gaurd Routes
- You can restrict the route path from access.
- Only authorized users can access the path.
- Cookies are used for authorization.

                               Cookies
- Cookie is a simple text document.
- It store the client authentication details on client machine.
- It provides access to various resources by providing the client details to server when ever required.
- JavaScript provides "navigator" object with "cookieEnabled" property, which verifies the cookie status in browser.
            BOM
            window, history, navigator, location, document
- Cookies are classified into 2 types
    a) In-memory cookie  [Temporary - Browser Memory]
    b) Persistent cookie   [Permanent - Client HDD]

- React can use cookies for Gaurding your Routes.
- React have to depend on various 3rd party libraries.

Setup Application for Cookies
1. Install cookie library
    > npm install react-cookie --save

2. Cookie is a provided as a service.
     - Service is a pre-defined business logic.
    - Service uses "Single Ton" pattern.
    - Service follows "Dependency Injection" mechanism.
    - DI uses 2 components
        a) Provider
        b) Injector
    - Provider is reponsible for locating the value in memory.
    - Injector is responsible to injecting the value into component.
    - You have to configure cookie provider at application level.

                index.js
    import  { CookiesProviders } from  'react-cookie';

    <CookieProvider>
       <YourIndexComponent />
    </CookieProvider>

3. Create cookie from any component

    import  { useCookies }  from  'react-cookie';

    const [cookies, setCookie, removeCookie] = useCookies();

    setCookie("Name", "Value", { expiry:date });

4. Access Cookie to verify authentication

    cookies[Name]

5. Remove Cookie

    removeCookie(Name);
