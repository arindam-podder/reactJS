- React uses client side routing.

- Client side routing enables SPA [Single Page Application]
  environment.

- SPA allows the user to stay to on one page and get
  acess to everything on to the page.

- Routing uses implicitly Ajax

- Routing allows to load new content into page without reloading the page.

- React provides a routing library "react-router-dom", which enables SPA environment.

- React routing library current active versions are
        a) Version-5  [upto react 17]
        b) Version-6  [from react 18]

- Routing library is backward compatible
        React 18 => can use V5 & V6

- Lot of changes are made in new Version of route.

- "react-router-dom" library provides following components

    <BrowserRouter>        It configures routing that maps virtual DOM
                                to the actual DOM.
    <Routes>                It is used to configure a Route Table.
                                Route Table comprises of collection of routes.
    <Route>                    It configures path and component.            
    <Link>                    It is used for navigation.
                                <a> can't be used for route path.
    <Outlet>                    It specifies the target location where the
                                result is rendered.

- "react-router-dom" library provides following Hooks

     useNavigate
     useParams
     useSearchParams
     useLocation
     useHistory  etc..

Syntax:
        <BrowserRouter>
            <Routes>
                <Route path="/"  element={ <Component /> } />
                <Route path="/login" element={ <Login /> } />
            </Routes>
        </BrowserRouter>

Ex:
Tutorial.js


import { BrowserRouter, Link, Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";


export function Tutorial(){
    return(
        <div className="container-fluid">
          <h2>Web Technologies - Tutorial</h2>
          <BrowserRouter>
             <nav>
                <span> <Link to="html">HTML</Link> </span>
                <span>|</span>
                <span> <Link to="css">CSS</Link> </span>
                <span>|</span>
                <span> <Link to="react">React</Link> </span>
             </nav>
             <hr />
             <section>
                <Routes>
                    <Route path="/html" element={<div><h2>HTML</h2><p>It is a markup language.</p></div>} />
                    <Route path="/css" element={<div><h2>CSS</h2><p>It defines styles form HTML.</p></div>} />
                    <Route path="/react" element={<div><h2>React</h2><p>It is a JavaScript library.</p></div>} />
                    <Route path="/" element={<div><p>Browse our online tutorials</p></div>} />
                </Routes>
             </section>
          </BrowserRouter>
