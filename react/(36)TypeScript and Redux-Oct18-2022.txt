TypeScript
- It is a language introduced and maintained by Microsoft.
- Anderns Hejlsberg is the lead architect of TypeScript.
- It is used to build large scale applications.

Issues of JavaScript
- It is not strongly typed.
- It is not implicitly strictly typed.
- It will not support all OOP features.
- Extensibility
- Code Security

Draw Backs of OOP
- They don't support low level features
- They can't directly interact with Hardware Services
- They need more memory
- They are slow.
- They are complex.

Features of TypeScript:
------------------------------------
- TypeScript is an OOP language.
- TypeScript is strongly typed.
- TypeScript is strictly typed.
- TypeScript is built in TypeScript.
- It supports all low level features.
- It can directly interact with hardware services.
- It is faster.
- It uses less memory.

Note: Web Application have to target browser and TypeScript is not understandable to browser. TypeScript is translated into JavaScript.

   
                            TypeScript Architecture

1. Core Compiler
    - Identifying the syntax errors
    - Verifying keywords
    - Reporting the erorrs

    core.ts                verifying code with keywords and syntax
    program.ts            verifies the structure.
    scanner.ts            handling input
    emitter.ts                handling output
    parser.ts                type parsing
    checker.ts            verifies data type

2. Standalone Compiler [tsc.ts]
    - It translates the TypeScript language into JavaScript

3. Language Service [Service.ts]
   - It provides all the data and functions required for typescript.

4. TS Server  [Server.ts]
   - hosting typescript programs
   - compiling and processing
   - handling request and response

5. VS Shim
   - It is used to make your code platform neutral.
   - It makes type script cross platform.

6. Managed Language Service
   - It is the service that comprises of functions and values, that can run on any
    OS  services.


 TypeScript Code => Compiled => Un Managed Code => Shim => Managed => Any OS

7. Editors
   - TypeScript provides editor configuration file that set rules for typescript.
                "tsconfig.json"


                                React TypeScript Extentions
                                ---------------------------------------
.ts                    : contracts, templates
.tsx                : components


Setup React Project with TypeScript
--------------------------------------------------
1. Install TypeScript on your PC

        >npm install -g typescript
        >tsc -v  

2. Create a new React Application with TypeScript

        E:\> npx create-react-app  appName  -template typescript


                        TypeScript Language Basics
- Variables
- DataTypes
- Operators
- Statements


                                 Variables
- Same as JavaScript
        a) var
        b) let
        c) const
- Variables are defined with type

        let  variableName:dataType;

- All JavaScript Data Types are same in TypeScript

        a) Primitive Types
                number, string, boolean, null, undefined

        b) Non Primitive Type
                array, object, map

Primitive Types

let UserName:string = "John";
let Age:number = 33;
let Subscribed:boolean = true;

- TypeScript uses "any" as root type.
- TypeScript supports Union of types.

        let  value:string|number;
        let  value:string|number|boolean;

Ex:
let username:string|null = prompt("Enter Name");
let price:number|undefined;
console.log("Price=" + price);
