What is React? How it is different from Angular?
When to use React and Angular?
What we can do with React?

Features of React
1. Virtual DOM
   a) DOM
   b) Shadow DOM
   c) Virtual DOM

What is DOM?
Document Object Model
Hierarchy of presenting elements. It is used to create a layout.

markup => bytes => chars => token => node => DOM => layout => render => painting

What is CSSOM?
CSS Object Model
Applying styles to HTML elements.

What is Shadow DOM?
- It define "Component Object Model"
- Every component in HTML is built with shadow DOM.
   <input type=date, color, file, email>

What is Virtual DOM?
- It is a copy of actual DOM in browser memory.
- It updates and renders result faster.


2. React is Asynchronous and Modular
- Only the library that is required for application will be loaded.
- Application specific library.
- Application light weight
- Faster
- Async allows to perform any task without blocking other tasks.
- Implicitly using Ajax.

3. Loosely coupled and extensibile
- Allows to plugin various 3rd party libraries to handle different interactions.
- To fill the GAPS

        Formik            - Forms
        Yup                - Validations
        Axios                - API Requests
        Redux            - State Management

4. React can use various frameworks
        MVC
        MVVM
    Framework is required to control the flow of application.

5. It reduces lot of DOM manipulations

        document.createElement()
        appendChild()
        innerText, innerHTML

6. Component Based
        - Reusability
        - Separation
        - Extensibility
